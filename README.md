# Product-Comparision
This project leverages autonomous AI agents to automate multi-source product comparison. The system integrates web automation, natural language processing, and intelligent orchestration to gather, verify, and summarize product information from diverse online platforms.

Core Idea: Build AI agents capable of browsing e-commerce websites, extracting product details (price, specifications, reviews, availability), and presenting structured comparisons to assist decision-making.

Tech Stack:

Playwright for dynamic web scraping and navigation.

Autogen Agents (v0.71 stable) for orchestrating task execution, including a checker agent that validates extracted data for accuracy and consistency.

LLM-driven summarization for transforming raw product data into concise, human-readable insights.

Key Features:

Automated comparison of 5 products across 2â€“3 sources each.

Data verification through an embedded cancellation factor to reduce faulty or redundant agent actions.

Scalable design that can expand to more products, categories, and sources.

Outcome: A reliable, efficient, and scalable tool that empowers businesses and consumers with real-time, accurate product insights, reducing manual effort in research and evaluation.
